/**
 * Date forms NOAA CDO accepts: a compact `YYYYMMDD`, a dashed calendar date
 * whose month and day may be unpadded, or a dashed date with a full ISO-8601
 * local time and optional fractional seconds. CDO rejects a `Z` suffix, a UTC
 * offset, and a space separator, so those are excluded deliberately rather than
 * by oversight. A minute-precision time (`T00:00`) is excluded on the same
 * grounds, though only `/data` rejects it — `/locations` and the other
 * collection endpoints answer it with a 200. Second-precision (`T00:00:00`) is
 * equivalent and accepted everywhere, so the schema keeps the stricter rule.
 *
 * CDO's parsers disagree on the other two forms: `/data` rejects a compact
 * `startdate` with a misleading range error and rejects the unpadded dashed
 * form outright, while every other endpoint accepts both. Tools therefore send
 * `toCdoWireDate()` output upstream rather than the caller's raw string, which
 * makes every form advertised here work on every endpoint without a
 * per-endpoint schema variant.
 *
 * Structural bounds (month, day, hour, minute, second ranges) live in the
 * pattern so they reach clients through the advertised JSON Schema; only
 * month-length overflow needs the refinement below.
