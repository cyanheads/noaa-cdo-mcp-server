## Overview

`noaa-climate-mcp-server` exposes NOAA's Climate Data Online (CDO) API v2 to LLM agents. It provides access to historical weather observations, climate summaries, and station metadata going back centuries. The primary use case is answering questions like "what's the historical climate at location X?" or "what were the temperatures and precipitation at station Y between these dates?"

It complements the `nws-weather-mcp-server` (real-time forecasts and alerts) by providing the historical record — together they form a complete weather data stack for agents.

The API wraps `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/`.

## Requirements

- Read-only access to NOAA CDO API v2
- API token required (free registration at ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token; token passed as `token` request header)
- Rate limits: 5 requests/second, 10,000 requests/day per token
- Seven endpoints exposed: datasets, datacategories, datatypes, locationcategories, locations, stations, data
- Date range constraints: sub-daily, daily, and radar data (GHCND, PRECIP_*, NORMAL_DLY, NORMAL_HLY, NEXRAD2, NEXRAD3) limited to 1-year ranges per request; monthly/annual data (GSOM, GSOY, NORMAL_MLY, NORMAL_ANN) limited to 10-year ranges
- Pagination: offset/limit pattern; max 1000 results per request
- Units: `standard` or `metric` for data endpoint; no scaling without explicit `units` param
- Base URL: `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/`

## Services

| Service | Wraps | Used By |
|:--------|:------|:--------|
| `CdoService` | NOAA CDO API v2 (`https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/`) | All tools, both resources |
| `StormEventsService` | NCEI Storm Events bulk CSV export (`https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/`) | `noaa_climate_search_storm_events` |
| `BillionDollarDisastersService` | NCEI Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters CSV exports (`https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/`) | `noaa_climate_get_billion_dollar_disasters` |
| `CsvStreamReader` (`src/services/csv/`) | Not an upstream — the incremental RFC 4180 reader both bulk-CSV services parse with | `StormEventsService`, `BillionDollarDisastersService` |

**Parameter name translation.** MCP input schemas use camelCase (`datasetId`, `locationId`, `stationId`, `datatypeId`, `datacategoryId`). The CDO API requires all lowercase (`datasetid`, `locationid`, `stationid`, `datatypeid`, `datacategoryid`). `CdoService` is responsible for this translation — do not rely on the caller to pass lowercase keys.

**Storm Events is a second upstream, not an extension of CDO.** `StormEventsService` shares no code with `CdoService`: there is no token, no JSON envelope, and no `resolveCollectionTotal()` — a bulk CSV result set has a known total once scanned, so `totalCount` and `exhausted` are computed directly. Three properties of the upstream shape the service:

- **Filenames are discovered, never constructed.** Each year is published as `StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d{year}_c{publishDate}.csv.gz`, and `{publishDate}` is whenever NCEI last republished that year — 2024 and 2025 sit at `_c20260728` while 2023 is `_c20260323`. The service reads the directory index and selects the highest `_c` date per year. A republish removes the file it supersedes, so a name held from a six-hour-old listing can 404; the service treats that as an upstream republish, drops the listing, and re-resolves once before failing.
- **Decompression is explicit.** The files are served as `Content-Type: application/gzip` with no `Content-Encoding` header, so `fetch` returns the compressed bytes untouched. The service pipes them through `DecompressionStream('gzip')` and an incremental CSV reader, so the ~70 MB decompressed form is never materialized. A body that will not decompress — an HTML error page under HTTP 200, a truncated transfer — is reclassified as an upstream availability failure and its bytes are evicted, so a bad download cannot be replayed from cache.
- **Damage values are magnitude-suffixed strings.** `H`/`K`/`M`/`B` suffixes, bare numbers (not always `0`), and abbreviated fractions (`.5M`) all occur; an empty cell means "not reported" and is preserved as an absent value rather than `0`, and a cell that does not parse keeps its raw text with no amount. See `src/services/storm-events/damage.ts`.

**Caching bounds.** The directory listing and up to two years of compressed bytes are held for six hours, then re-fetched — NCEI republishes a year under a new `_c` suffix at any time. Two resident years stay under 30 MB: a recent bundle is about 12 MB and the largest, 2011, is 15 MB. That is the retained set, not the memory envelope — 2024 decompresses to 66.6 MB in 4,272 16 KB chunks, and a cold full-year scan of it measured 129 MB RSS at baseline against a 269 MB peak, climbing further across repeated scans. The chunk strings are transient garbage the collector reclaims, not retention, but sizing the process against the ~30 MB cache figure would be wrong.

**Billion-Dollar Disasters is a third upstream, and its defining hazard is units.** `BillionDollarDisastersService` reads four small static CSVs — `events-US.csv` (403 rows), `time-series-US.csv` (45 rows), and their `events-{STATE}.csv` / `time-series-{STATE}.csv` variants. No token, no gzip, no filename discovery: they are plain `text/csv` at fixed names, small enough to buffer whole, so the streaming machinery Storm Events needs would be overhead here. Four properties shape the service:

- **The exports do not share a cost unit, and each states its own.** `events-*.csv` declares "Cost values are in millions of dollars"; `time-series-US.csv` declares billions; `time-series-{STATE}.csv` declares millions again. A figure read under the wrong one is wrong by three orders of magnitude and still entirely plausible — Hurricane Helene's `78721` is $78.7B, not $78,721B. The service therefore parses the unit out of each file's own preamble and scales at a single site, `toUsd()`, publishing whole US dollars and echoing the unit it read as `declaredCostUnit`. An unrecognized or absent unit is `malformed_export`, never a default.
- **Every file opens with lines that are neither data nor header.** `events-*.csv` leads with a title line and the unit note; `time-series-*.csv` leads with two `#` comments and a blank line. Treating row 1 as the header silently mis-keys every column, so the header is located by name (`Name` or `State`) and everything above it is read only for the unit.
- **The per-state per-year export has a different shape, not just a different scope.** It publishes `"<Type> Cost Range"` — a binned range like `2000-5000` — where the national file publishes `"<Type> Cost"` plus six 75/90/95% confidence-bound columns. Which shape a file carries is read off its header rather than inferred from the scope, so one parser handles both.
- **Per-state per-event rows carry the national cost.** The state exports select national disasters that reached the state; they do not apportion cost. Summing per-state figures double-counts, and the tool description says so.

**Caching bounds.** Up to eight parsed exports are held for six hours, then re-fetched — NCEI adds a year once its assessment settles and revises prior years' CPI adjustments with it. The bound exists so a long-lived process does not accumulate one entry per state and territory; a parsed export is a few hundred rows, so bytes are not the concern.

**Coverage trails the calendar.** The corpus runs from 1980 to the last fully assessed year — 2024 as of writing, not the current year. The service reports the span it actually found in the rows rather than assuming same-year freshness, and a query past the end returns an empty page with a notice, not an error.

## Config

| Env Var | Required | Description |
|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| `NOAA_CDO_TOKEN` | Yes | API token from ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token. Sent as `token` header on every request. |

## Implementation Order

1. Config (`src/config/server-config.ts`) — `NOAA_CDO_TOKEN` via `parseEnvConfig`
2. `CdoService` — typed HTTP client with retry, rate-limit handling, pagination helper
3. `noaa_climate_list_datasets`, `noaa_climate_list_data_categories`, `noaa_climate_list_data_types` — reference/discovery tools (simplest; no required params)
4. `noaa_climate_find_locations` — location search (required for navigation workflows)
5. `noaa_climate_find_stations`, `noaa_climate_get_station` — station discovery and lookup
6. `noaa_climate_fetch_data` — observation data retrieval (most complex; requires all prior pieces)
7. Resources: `noaa://datasets` (small, stable list), `noaa://stations/{stationId}` (wraps get_station)
8. `StormEventsService` + `noaa_climate_search_storm_events` — second upstream (NCEI bulk CSV); independent of every step above
9. `BillionDollarDisastersService` + `noaa_climate_get_billion_dollar_disasters` — third upstream (NCEI Billions CSV); shares only the CSV reader with step 8

Each step is independently testable against the live API.

## Domain Mapping

The NOAA CDO data model has five entity types and one data-fetch endpoint:

| Entity | API Endpoint | Key ID Format | Notes |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|:------|
| Dataset | `/datasets` or `/datasets/{id}` | `GHCND`, `GSOM`, `GSOY`, `NORMAL_DLY`, `NORMAL_MLY`, `NORMAL_ANN`, `NORMAL_HLY`, `PRECIP_15`, `PRECIP_HLY`, `NEXRAD2`, `NEXRAD3` | 11–13 via API; primary ones are GHCND, GSOM, GSOY, NORMAL_DLY |
| Data category | `/datacategories` or `/datacategories/{id}` | `TEMP`, `PRCP`, `WIND`, `PRES`, `SUN`, `SKY`, `WXTYPE`, `ANNAGR`, etc. | ~41 categories; groups data types |
| Data type | `/datatypes` or `/datatypes/{id}` | `TMAX`, `TMIN`, `TOBS`, `PRCP`, `SNOW`, `SNWD`, `AWND`, etc. | Hundreds; the actual measurement labels |
| Location category | `/locationcategories` | `CITY`, `CLIM_DIV`, `CLIM_REG`, `CNTRY`, `CNTY`, `HYD_ACC`, `HYD_CAT`, `HYD_REG`, `HYD_SUB`, `ST`, `US_TERR`, `ZIP` | 12 categories; hierarchical geography |
| Location | `/locations` or `/locations/{id}` | `FIPS:37` (state), `CITY:US390029`, `ZIP:28801`, `FIPS:US` (country) | Filtered by `locationcategoryid` |
| Station | `/stations` or `/stations/{id}` | `GHCND:USC00010008`, `COOP:010008` | Supports bounding box via `extent` param |
| Data | `/data` | n/a (query-only) | Requires `datasetid`, `startdate`, `enddate`; returns `{date, datatype, station, value, attributes}` |

### Billion-Dollar Disasters Corpus

A separate NCEI corpus with no CDO entity model — four static CSVs under `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/`, addressed by scope rather than by ID. Costs are stated per file and differ; the server converts every one to whole US dollars.

| Export | Rows | Declared cost unit | Cost shape |
|:-------|:-----|:-------------------|:-----------|
| `events-US.csv` | 403 (1980–2024) | millions of dollars | Per disaster: CPI-adjusted and unadjusted point costs |
| `time-series-US.csv` | 45 (one per year) | **billions** of dollars | Per year per class: point cost plus 75/90/95% confidence bounds |
| `events-{STATE}.csv` | varies | millions of dollars | Per disaster, carrying the **national** cost of a disaster that reached the state |
| `time-series-{STATE}.csv` | 45 (one per year) | millions of dollars | Per year per class: a binned range (`2000-5000`), no point estimate, no bounds |

`{STATE}` is a two-letter postal code. The 50 states, DC, PR, VI, and GU have exports; AS and MP return 404. The seven `Disaster` values are `Drought`, `Flooding`, `Freeze`, `Severe Storm`, `Tropical Cyclone`, `Wildfire`, `Winter Storm`; the per-year exports carry an eighth column group, `All Disasters`, which is the year's total rather than a class.

## Workflow Analysis

### Primary workflow: station → data

The most common agent workflow is "find stations near a place, then query historical data":

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|:-----|:-----|:-------------|
| 1 | `noaa_climate_find_locations` | Find a location ID for a city, state, or zip — e.g., `CITY:US530018` for Seattle |
| 2 | `noaa_climate_find_stations` | Find stations within that location that support the desired dataset and data types |
| 3 | `noaa_climate_fetch_data` | Fetch observations for chosen stations over the desired date range |

### Discovery workflow: what's available?

When the agent doesn't know what data exists:

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|:-----|:-----|:-------------|
| 1 | `noaa_climate_list_datasets` | See all available datasets and their temporal coverage |
| 2 | `noaa_climate_list_data_categories` | Browse measurement groups (Temperature, Precipitation, etc.) |
| 3 | `noaa_climate_list_data_types` | Get specific measurement IDs (TMAX, PRCP, etc.) for the chosen dataset |

### Climate profile workflow

"What's the typical climate in X?" — uses climate normals:

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|:-----|:-----|:-------------|
| 1 | `noaa_climate_find_stations` | Find stations with `datasetId=NORMAL_DLY` near the location |
| 2 | `noaa_climate_fetch_data` | Query `NORMAL_DLY` with `startDate=2010-01-01`, `endDate=2010-12-31` for the full normal year |

Use `NORMAL_HLY` (hourly) or `NORMAL_MLY` (monthly) for coarser granularity. All normals datasets use the same 2010-proxy date range.

## Tool Detail

### `noaa_climate_list_datasets`

- **Description**: List available NOAA CDO datasets with their IDs, names, and temporal coverage. Returns all ~11 datasets by default (no required params). Optionally filter to datasets that contain a specific data type, cover a location or station, or overlap a date range.
- **Input**: `datatypeId?: string[]`, `locationId?: string`, `stationId?: string`, `startDate?: string` (ISO), `endDate?: string` (ISO), `sortField?: enum('id'|'name'|'mindate'|'maxdate'|'datacoverage')`, `sortOrder?: enum('asc'|'desc')`, `limit: number (default 25, max 1000)`, `offset: number (default 0)`
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ id, name, datacoverage, mindate, maxdate }>, metadata: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'Bad date format or unknown ID' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`

### `noaa_climate_list_data_categories`

- **Description**: List data categories that group related data types — Temperature, Precipitation, Wind, etc. Use to discover what types of measurements are available before calling `noaa_climate_list_data_types`. Optionally filter by dataset, location, station, or date range.
- **Input**: `datasetId?: string`, `locationId?: string`, `stationId?: string`, `startDate?: string`, `endDate?: string`, `sortField?`, `sortOrder?`, `limit`, `offset`
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ id, name }>, metadata: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'A filter parameter is not recognized by the CDO API' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`

### `noaa_climate_list_data_types`

- **Description**: List available data types (measurement labels like TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW) for a given dataset or category. Pass a `datasetId` to see what's measured in that dataset, or a `datacategoryId` (e.g., `TEMP`) to see all temperature-related types. Required before querying data when the data type IDs are unknown.
- **Input**: `datasetId?: string`, `datacategoryId?: string`, `locationId?: string`, `stationId?: string`, `startDate?: string`, `endDate?: string`, `sortField?`, `sortOrder?`, `limit`, `offset`
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ id, name, datacoverage, mindate, maxdate }>, metadata: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'A filter parameter is not recognized by the CDO API' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`

### `noaa_climate_list_location_categories`

- **Description**: List the location categories that scope `noaa_climate_find_locations` — 12 in total: `CITY`, `CLIM_DIV`, `CLIM_REG`, `CNTRY`, `CNTY`, `HYD_ACC`, `HYD_CAT`, `HYD_REG`, `HYD_SUB`, `ST`, `US_TERR`, `ZIP`. Call it when the `locationCategoryId` to use is unknown.
- **Input**: `sortField?: enum('id'|'name')`, `sortOrder?: enum('asc'|'desc')`, `limit: number (default 25, max 1000)`, `offset: number (default 0)`. No domain filters — CDO ignores `datasetid`, `locationid`, `stationid`, and the date range on `/locationcategories`, verified live.
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ id, name }>, metadata: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'A pagination or sort parameter is not recognized' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`

### `noaa_climate_find_locations`

- **Description**: Search for geographic locations by category (CITY, ST, CNTY, CNTRY, ZIP, CLIM_REG, etc.). Returns location IDs used in station search and data queries. Without `locationCategoryId`, returns all location types. Use `locationCategoryId=ST` to list US states (51), `locationCategoryId=CITY` for cities (1,989). The API has no name-search parameter, so `nameContains` synthesizes one client-side for any category of at most 4,000 locations; past that limit — `ZIP` (30,415) — narrow with `datasetId`/`datacategoryId`, or sort alphabetically with `sortField=name` and page through results. Location IDs follow formats like `FIPS:37` (state), `CITY:US530018` (city), `ZIP:98101`.
- **Input**: `locationCategoryId?: string` (e.g., `ST`, `CITY`, `CNTY`, `CNTRY`, `ZIP`, `US_TERR`, `CLIM_REG`; enumerate with `noaa_climate_list_location_categories`), `nameContains?: string` — case-insensitive substring match applied after a full client-side enumeration of the category; requires `locationCategoryId` and a category of at most 4,000 locations, `datasetId?: string`, `datacategoryId?: string`, `startDate?: string`, `endDate?: string`, `sortField?: enum('id'|'name'|'mindate'|'maxdate'|'datacoverage')`, `sortOrder?: enum('asc'|'desc')`, `limit: number (default 25, max 1000)`, `offset: number (default 0)`
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ id, name, datacoverage, mindate, maxdate }>, appliedNameFilter?: string, metadata: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`. With `nameContains` active, `count` is the exact post-filter match total and `offset` echoes the caller's zero-based offset — never CDO's raw echo from the internal enumeration fetch.
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'A filter parameter is not recognized by the CDO API' }`, `{ reason: 'name_filter_requires_category', code: ValidationError, when: 'nameContains supplied without locationCategoryId' }`, `{ reason: 'name_filter_category_too_large', code: ValidationError, when: 'The category holds more locations than nameContains can enumerate' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true`

### `noaa_climate_find_stations`

- **Description**: Search for weather observation stations by location, bounding box, dataset, and data type. Returns station IDs, names, coordinates, elevation, and data coverage dates. Filters by `locationId` (e.g., `FIPS:37` for NC), `extent` (lat/lon bounding box as `"minLat,minLon,maxLat,maxLon"`), `datasetId`, `datatypeId`, and date range. Station IDs returned here are used as `stationId` in `noaa_climate_fetch_data`.
- **Input**: `locationId?: string`, `extent?: string` (e.g., `"47.5,-122.4,47.7,-122.1"`), `datasetId?: string`, `datatypeId?: string[]`, `datacategoryId?: string`, `startDate?: string`, `endDate?: string`, `sortField?`, `sortOrder?`, `limit`, `offset`
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ id, name, latitude, longitude, elevation, mindate, maxdate, datacoverage }>, metadata: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'A filter parameter is not recognized by the CDO API' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true`

### `noaa_climate_get_station`

- **Description**: Fetch full metadata for a single weather station by its ID (e.g., `GHCND:USW00024233`, `COOP:010008`). Returns name, coordinates, elevation, and the full date range for which data is available. Use when you have a station ID from `noaa_climate_find_stations` and want its details.
- **Input**: `stationId: string` (e.g., `GHCND:USW00024233`)
- **Output**: `{ id, name, latitude, longitude, elevation, mindate, maxdate, datacoverage }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'not_found', code: NotFound, when: 'Station ID format is valid but no station exists with that ID' }`, `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`

### `noaa_climate_fetch_data`

- **Description**: Fetch historical observation records from a NOAA CDO dataset for a given date range. Requires a `datasetId` (e.g., `GHCND` for daily, `GSOM` for monthly), `startDate`, and `endDate`. Optionally scope to specific stations, locations, and data types. Sub-daily, daily, and radar data (GHCND, PRECIP_15, PRECIP_HLY, NORMAL_DLY, NORMAL_HLY, NEXRAD2, NEXRAD3) is limited to a 1-year date range per request; monthly and annual data (GSOM, GSOY, NORMAL_MLY, NORMAL_ANN) is limited to 10 years. Returns a flat array of `{ date, datatype, station, value, attributes }` records. Specify `units=metric` or `units=standard` to scale values; without a `units` parameter, raw unscaled values are returned — for GHCND, temperatures are in tenths of degrees and precipitation in tenths of mm (e.g., raw TMAX=256 → 25.6°C with `units=metric`; raw PRCP=12 → 1.2mm).
- **Input**:
  - `datasetId: string` — `.describe('Dataset ID (e.g., GHCND for daily data, GSOM for monthly, GSOY for annual, NORMAL_DLY/MLY/ANN/HLY for 1981-2010 climate normals, NEXRAD2/NEXRAD3 for weather radar). Determines the date range limit: sub-daily, daily, and radar datasets (GHCND, PRECIP_15, PRECIP_HLY, NORMAL_DLY, NORMAL_HLY, NEXRAD2, NEXRAD3) allow 1-year max per request; monthly/annual datasets (GSOM, GSOY, NORMAL_MLY, NORMAL_ANN) allow 10-year max.')` 
  - `startDate: string` (ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`) — `.describe('Start date for observations. For NORMAL_* datasets use 2010-01-01 regardless of the years being analyzed.')`
  - `endDate: string` (ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`) — `.describe('End date for observations. Must be within 1 year of startDate for sub-daily/daily/radar datasets (GHCND, PRECIP_15, PRECIP_HLY, NORMAL_DLY, NORMAL_HLY, NEXRAD2, NEXRAD3) or within 10 years for monthly/annual datasets (GSOM, GSOY, NORMAL_MLY, NORMAL_ANN). For any NORMAL_* dataset use 2010-12-31.')`
  - `stationId?: string[]` — `.describe('One or more station IDs to filter by (e.g., ["GHCND:USW00024233"]). Obtain from noaa_climate_find_stations. Serialized to ampersand-chained query params.')`
  - `locationId?: string[]` — `.describe('One or more location IDs to filter by (e.g., ["FIPS:37", "ZIP:98101"]). Broader than stationId — returns all data within the location.')`
  - `datatypeId?: string[]` — `.describe('One or more data type IDs to include (e.g., ["TMAX","TMIN","PRCP"]). Without this, all data types for the dataset are returned. Use noaa_climate_list_data_types to discover valid IDs.')`
  - `units?: enum('standard'|'metric')` — `.describe('Unit system for returned values. Without this, GHCND returns raw tenths-of-unit integers (TMAX=256 = 25.6°C). Strongly recommended: pass metric or standard to get human-readable scaled values.')`
  - `includemetadata?: boolean (default true)`
  - `sortField?`, `sortOrder?`, `limit`, `offset`
- **Output**: `{ results: Array<{ date, datatype, station, value, attributes }>, metadata?: { resultset: { count, limit, offset } } }`
- **Errors**: `{ reason: 'service_unavailable', code: ServiceUnavailable, when: 'CDO API is down or unreachable', retryable: true }`, `{ reason: 'date_range_exceeded', code: InvalidParams, when: 'Date range exceeds 1 year for sub-daily/daily/radar datasets (GHCND, PRECIP_*, NORMAL_DLY, NORMAL_HLY, NEXRAD2, NEXRAD3) or 10 years for monthly/annual datasets (GSOM, GSOY, NORMAL_MLY, NORMAL_ANN)' }`, `{ reason: 'upstream_auth_failed', code: ConfigurationError, when: 'CDO rejected the API token this server is configured with' }`, `{ reason: 'validation_error', code: ValidationError, when: 'Bad dataset ID, date format, or unknown station/location ID' }`
- **Annotations**: `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true`

## Design Decisions

**1. `noaa_climate_list_location_categories` is a first-class discovery tool.**
`/locationcategories` returns 12 stable ID/name pairs. Keeping them in the `noaa_climate_find_locations` parameter prose alone let one — `US_TERR` — go missing, and left the hydrological categories buried in a sentence rather than reachable by a call. The tool takes pagination and sort only: CDO ignores `datasetid`, `locationid`, `stationid`, and the date range on this endpoint, so offering those filters would advertise narrowing that never happens.

**2. `noaa_climate_find_locations` has `openWorldHint: true`, discovery tools have `false`.**
Datasets, categories, and data types are small, bounded, stable lists (the full universe fits in one or two pages). Locations — cities, counties, zip codes — are a large open corpus. `openWorldHint` accurately communicates this to clients.

**3. `noaa_climate_fetch_data` returns flat records, not pivoted tables.**
The CDO API returns `{ date, datatype, station, value }` tuples, not wide rows per date. Preserving this shape avoids fabricating a schema that doesn't match the data. The agent can pivot as needed. Pivoting in the server would also require knowing all the data types in advance, which creates coupling.

**4. Rate limit handling in the service layer, not in tools.**
The 5 req/s limit is best managed at the HTTP client level (token-bucket or retry-after backoff), not distributed across seven tool handlers. `CdoService` owns this concern.

**5. No workflow tool for "find stations and fetch data" composite.**
The primary workflow (find location → find stations → fetch data) is simple enough for agents to execute step-by-step with three tool calls. The intermediate state (location IDs, station IDs) is naturally captured by the agent. A composite workflow tool would save a round-trip but at the cost of a bloated, hard-to-test tool with many conditional parameters. Keep tools focused.

**6. Resources are supplementary only.**
`noaa://datasets` provides injectable context for clients that support resources, covering the small stable dataset list. `noaa://stations/{stationId}` mirrors `noaa_climate_get_station`. Both are optional — tools cover the same data.

**7. No prompt templates.**
This is a data-access server. The interaction patterns are "query → result", not structured workflows that benefit from templates.

**8. `noaa_climate_fetch_data` accepts arrays for `stationId` and `locationId`.**
The CDO API supports comma-separated or chained IDs for filtering. Accepting arrays on the MCP side and serializing them to the API's expected format is more ergonomic for agents. Common workflow: search returns several stations, agent passes all of them to fetch_data to get comparative readings.

## Known Limitations

- **No geocoding.** The CDO API has no lat/lon-to-location-name lookup. Agents that start with a place name must either know the location ID (e.g., FIPS code) or use `noaa_climate_find_locations` to search by name within a category.
- **No upstream text search on locations.** The `/locations` endpoint has no name-search or substring-filter parameter — only `sortfield=name` for alphabetical ordering. `noaa_climate_find_locations` synthesizes one client-side via `nameContains`: it enumerates the requested category (up to four `limit=1000` fetches, the largest burst that fits inside CDO's 5-requests-per-second limit) and substring-matches the names, which covers every category of at most 4,000 locations — every one but `ZIP` (30,415). Past the limit, narrow with `datasetId`/`datacategoryId`, page alphabetically, or use a known location ID format (e.g., `FIPS:37` for NC). Station search by `locationId` still requires an exact location ID — there is no name-based station lookup.
- **Date range limits.** Sub-daily, daily, and radar datasets are limited to 1-year per request; monthly/annual to 10 years. Multi-year daily analyses require sequential requests — each consuming daily quota.
- **10,000 requests/day ceiling.** Bulk historical analysis across many stations and long date ranges will hit the daily limit. Agents should prefer monthly (GSOM) or annual (GSOY) datasets when fine-grained daily data isn't needed.
- **Raw units by default.** Without `units=metric` or `units=standard`, GHCND returns unscaled integer values (TMAX=256 = raw tenths-of-degrees-C, i.e., 25.6°C). GSOM/GSOY values are already scaled. Always recommend passing a `units` parameter so agents don't receive raw tenths-of-unit integers they must interpret manually. The `format()` function should annotate the unit system actually applied.
- **Climate normals are date-range-fixed.** NORMAL_DLY/MLY/ANN/HLY normals are the 1981–2010 climatological normals. Despite spanning 30 years of source data, they are accessed with `startdate=2010-01-01` and `enddate=2010-12-31` — the API uses 2010 as the proxy year for all normals queries. This is an API convention, not a bug.

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|:-----|:---------|:----------|
| 2026-05-23 | Single `CdoService` for all endpoints | All seven CDO endpoints share the same base URL, auth header, and pagination pattern. No benefit to splitting by endpoint. |
| 2026-05-23 | No `/locationcategories` tool | Only ~11 stable values; documenting them in the `noaa_climate_find_locations` description is sufficient. A dedicated tool would be called once and forgotten. |
| 2026-05-23 | Flat tuple output from `noaa_climate_fetch_data` | Preserves the CDO API's native response shape. Pivoting to wide-format would require knowing all requested data types upfront and introduces transformation errors. |
| 2026-05-23 | No composite station-search-and-fetch workflow tool | Three focused tools map to a simple three-step agent workflow. Combining them creates a bloated interface and moves error handling complexity into the tool. |
| 2026-05-23 | `openWorldHint: false` for reference/discovery tools | Datasets, categories, and data types are finite, enumerable lists the server can fully return. `openWorldHint: true` reserved for locations and stations (effectively unbounded). |
| 2026-05-23 | Arrays accepted for `stationId`/`locationId` in fetch_data | CDO API supports multiple IDs natively. Accepting arrays avoids forcing agents to loop and accumulate results manually — key for comparing readings across stations. |
| 2026-05-23 | Rate-limit handling owned by `CdoService` | Centralizing retry/backoff in the HTTP client prevents duplicating logic across seven tool handlers and ensures consistent behavior. |
| 2026-05-23 | Corrected rate limit: 10,000/day (not 1,000) | The official CDO API docs state 10,000 requests/day. The idea.md noted 1,000, which appears to be an older or incorrect figure. API docs are authoritative. |
| 2026-05-23 | Corrected list response shape: `results` key, not endpoint-named keys | Official CDO API returns `{"results": [...], "metadata": {"resultset": {"limit","count","offset"}}}`. All collection output schemas updated. |
| 2026-05-23 | Added NORMAL_HLY dataset | Exists as a full CDO dataset (hourly normals) omitted from initial design. |
| 2026-05-23 | Corrected date range limits for NORMAL_DLY/HLY | API classifies by temporal resolution, not dataset name. NORMAL_DLY and NORMAL_HLY follow the 1-year daily rule; NORMAL_MLY/ANN follow the 10-year monthly/annual rule. |
| 2026-08-18 | Reversed the 2026-05-23 "No `/locationcategories` tool" decision | The live endpoint returns 12 categories, not the ~11 the original entry assumed — the parameter prose omitted `US_TERR` entirely. The hydrological categories are also the entry point practitioners need, and `nameContains` makes picking a bounded category a real decision. `noaa_climate_list_location_categories` now enumerates them. |
| 2026-08-18 | `nameContains` eligibility is a live count, never a category allowlist | `HYD_CAT` (2,111) is larger than `CITY` (1,989), so any hardcoded "small categories" list gets it wrong, and a category can grow across the line. The handler reads `metadata.resultset.count` from its own first enumeration fetch and rejects past four `limit=1000` pages — four being the largest burst inside CDO's 5-requests-per-second limit, and 4,000 landing in the 9.6x gap between `CNTY` (3,178) and `ZIP` (30,415). |
| 2026-08-18 | `nameContains` enumerates fully, then filters, and synthesizes its own `metadata.resultset` | Filtering one upstream page would leave `totalCount` describing the raw category while the results describe the filtered set. Relaying CDO's raw echo reproduces the same lie in `metadata` and `format()`, since it describes an internal fetch the caller never made. |
| 2026-08-18 | Date-range cap follows CDO's month rule, not a fixed day count | Probing `/data` live: a request is accepted while `endDate` is on or before the last day of the calendar month N years after `startDate`'s month. The old 365/3650-day caps rejected a full leap year (366 days) and a full 10 calendar years (3,652 days) that CDO answers normally. |
| 2026-08-18 | Date filters go on the wire in the canonical `YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM:SS]` form, not the caller's string | CDO's parsers disagree with each other: `/data` rejects a compact `startdate` — with the misleading "The date range must be less than 1 year." — and rejects the unpadded dashed form outright, while every other endpoint accepts both. Normalizing at the edge keeps one schema across the whole surface *and* makes every advertised form work everywhere, which passing the caller's string through did not. |
| 2026-08-18 | `NEXRAD2`/`NEXRAD3` carry the 1-year cap | CDO documents the cap for daily datasets only, yet enforces the same calendar-month boundary on radar: from a 2020-03-10 start, 2021-04-01 answers "The date range must be less than 1 year." while 2021-03-31 gets past the range check. Uncapped, an over-long radar request was forwarded and the caller got that opaque upstream error in place of `date_range_exceeded` and its computed `maxEndDate`. |
| 2026-08-18 | Example station ID is `GHCND:USW00024233` | `GHCND:USC00450974` never resolved — CDO answers it with a bare `{}` — so an agent following the example landed on `not_found`. Replacements are verified against the live API before landing. |
| 2026-08-18 | Billion-Dollar Disasters costs are exposed in whole US dollars, not the units NCEI writes | NCEI declares three different cost units across the four exports — millions per-event, billions for the national per-year, millions again for a per-state per-year — so relaying each file's own unit would make `minCostInUsd` mean something different per call and make two responses from the same tool incomparable. One exposed unit removes the ambiguity, and the field names carry it (`cpiAdjustedCostInUsd`, `costRangeInUsd`). |
| 2026-08-18 | The cost multiplier is read from each file's preamble, never hardcoded per endpoint | Both files state their own unit in a leading comment line. Parsing it makes the declared unit the single source of truth, self-corrects if NCEI changes one, and turns an unrecognized unit into `malformed_export` instead of a silent 1,000x error. Hardcoding "events files are millions" would still be right today and wrong the moment NCEI restates a file. |
| 2026-08-18 | The Billions per-year exports are parsed off their header, not off the scope | The national file publishes `"<Type> Cost"` plus six confidence-bound columns; the per-state file publishes `"<Type> Cost Range"` with a binned value and no point estimate — a shape difference the issue's national-only reading did not anticipate. Reading which columns exist keeps one parser correct for both instead of branching on national-vs-state. |
| 2026-08-18 | `CsvStreamReader` moved to `src/services/csv/` | Two bulk-CSV services now parse with it. Importing it from inside `storm-events/` would imply a dependency on that domain that the Billions service does not have. Nothing else was extracted — filename discovery, gzip, the year LRU, and damage parsing are Storm Events' alone, and the Billions exports need none of them. |
| 2026-08-18 | `CdoService` recovers CDO's own rejection message before rethrowing | `fetchWithTimeout` throws on a non-2xx before anything reads the body, so every 4xx reached the client as `Fetch failed for <url>. Status: 400` — a bad date form, an over-long range, a missing parameter, and an over-large `limit` were indistinguishable, and the message leaked the fully-parameterized URL. The body is not lost: the helper captures it under `data.body`, so the message is recoverable. CDO writes most faults as XML `<developerMessage>` and its token failures as JSON `message`, so both are matched. |
| 2026-08-18 | A rejected API token routes to `upstream_auth_failed`, not `validation_error` | The token failure is the one 4xx a well-formed request hits routinely, and the caller's inputs are not what broke — `validation_error`'s recovery sends the agent to re-verify IDs that were never wrong, and every retry fails identically, so the advice loops. The new reason names `NOAA_CDO_TOKEN` as the thing to fix. Every CDO-backed tool declares it under the same `ConfigurationError` code so a client branches on one value, and one shared predicate (`shared/upstream-auth.ts`) decides the routing — each route sends the same `token` header, so a per-tool copy of the pattern would be a per-tool copy to drift. |
| 2026-08-18 | No routing on CDO's upstream range sentence | `KNOWN_DATASETS` is exactly `ONE_YEAR_DATASETS ∪ MONTHLY_DATASETS` and `maxSpanYearsForDataset()` returns a cap for every member, so a datasetId reaching the request always has a local cap and one that does not is rejected as `validation_error` before any request is made. The local caps were verified against CDO's own boundary: `GHCND` 2024-01-15..2025-01-31 answers 200 and 2025-02-01 answers 400; `GSOM` 2010-05-01..2020-05-31 answers 200 and 2020-06-01 answers 400. A branch on the upstream sentence was therefore unreachable, and a dataset CDO caps without documenting it is when it earns its place. |
| 2026-08-18 | An unexplained CDO failure carries a recovery hint of its own | CDO's front end answers an over-long request URL with HTTP 414 and an Apache error page — no `<developerMessage>`, no JSON `message` — and 414 maps to `InvalidRequest`, past every tool's `InvalidParams` routing, so the caller got a bare status with no next move. The hint is attached in `explainCdoFailure` where the message extraction already failed, covering every route at one site rather than capping `datatypeId` at a guessed array length. |
| 2026-08-18 | A state-scoped events response declares its `costBasis` | The per-state rows carry the whole disaster's national cost, which the tool description, README, and this doc all say — and none of which an agent re-reads while paging results. `scope: "CA"` beside `$30,000,000,000` reads as a California figure, so the response states the basis for itself, in `structuredContent` and in the rendered text. |
| 2026-08-18 | `coveredYears` is read from both ends of every row | The year filter matches on overlap, so a 2023 query returns a disaster that began in December 2022 — under a coverage line reading 1982–2022 when the span was built from begin years alone. The span now folds in end years, so it cannot end before a row the same response returned. |
| 2026-08-18 | `CLIM_REG:` is not a location ID prefix — climate regions are `CLIM:104` | `CLIM_REG` is the location *category*; its locations carry the `CLIM:` prefix. The documented `CLIM_REG:SOUTHATL` was unresolvable at the prefix, before its value was even in question. |
| 2026-08-18 | Example identifiers are checked against the live API in an opt-in `live` vitest project | Three dead example IDs reached production because nothing could catch them: the linter checks schema shape, typecheck cannot reach a string literal's meaning, and the unit suite runs on fixtures by design. Extraction is tractable because the identifiers have a rigid `PREFIX:VALUE` shape. The lane is a separate vitest project so `bun run test` stays hermetic; `bun run test:live` opts in. The extraction rules themselves are pinned by a hermetic unit test, so the live lane cannot pass by matching nothing. |
| 2026-05-23 | Added typed error contracts to all tools | Structured `{ reason, code, when, retryable }` format required for `ctx.fail` type-checking. |
| 2026-05-23 | Documented camelCase→lowercase param translation responsibility | CDO API requires lowercase param names; MCP input schemas use camelCase. CdoService owns the translation. |
